<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

I use the Inverse equation to compute the machine arm need to turn angle of rotation. After we use is to give the angel to control the arm, we can give the (x,y,z)point to control rotate correct angle and catch the bottle. And we will to develope the auto control by use OpenCv to judge when will to catch the printer components.
Today had install the PyQt5, we will study the QT tutorial, and develope beautiful interface to control our machine.
Vrep in Linux version need to makefile by youself, it have in remoteAPI in the folder, I can control Vrep in my ubuntu computer.
