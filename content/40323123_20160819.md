無法執行windows的動態連結庫，remoteAPI.dll

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Vrep haved install in Ubuntu and when we want to use our project control panel,because the RemoteAPI.dll isn't match with the Linux system, so how can we do for the remoteAPI.dll.

And why I use the English to write the blog,because my Ubuntu chinese input program didn't work on leo-editor, it can use everywhere but can't use in leo.
